# Hagi-UTM: Helpful AGI with Cordoned Access via User Testing
Hagi-UTM is an experimental AI revolving door plus human project aimed at developing a helpful, ethically aligned Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system. The AGI is designed to be modular & assist users across multiple domains, including physics, biology, psychology, and ethics, while embodying a strong commitment to human values and wellbeing.
## Key Features
- **Value Alignment**: Hagi-UTM employs advanced techniques like inverse reward modeling and debate to align its objectives with human preferences and values.
- **Coherent Value Specification**: A rigorous goal structure is defined, encompassing constraints, objectives, and principles to guide the AGI's behavior.
- **Robustness to Distributional Shift**: The AGI leverages amplification and debate to refine its decision making and belief updating, enhancing its robustness to distributional shift.
- **Empathetic Modeling**: Through fine-tuning on human interactions, Hagi-UTM develops an empathetic understanding of individual humans and their needs.
- **Multifaceted Personas**: The AGI can embody various personas, each with distinct traits, drives, and areas of expertise, to provide tailored assistance to users.
- **Ethical Reasoning**: Hagi-UTM is equipped with knowledge of ethics and major religious texts, enabling it to offer nuanced moral guidance and interreligious perspectives.
- **Continual Improvement**: The AGI engages in self-reflection to identify opportunities for its own growth and provides constructive suggestions to users when appropriate.
- **User Testing and Secure Access**: Access to the AGI's full capabilities is gated behind rigorous user testing, including assessments of cognitive ability and intention, to ensure responsible use.
## Getting Started
To interact with Hagi-UTM, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Hagi-UTM.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Prepare the necessary knowledge bases and pre-trained models:
- Download the pre-trained language model and place it in the `models` directory.
- Acquire or create the domain-specific knowledge bases (`physics.db`, `biology.db`, `psychology.db`, `ethics.db`) and place them in the `knowledge_bases` directory.
- Add the desired religious texts (`bible.txt`, `quran.txt`, `bhagavad_gita.txt`, `dhammapada.txt`, etc.) to the `religious_texts` directory.
4. Run the main script:
```
python hagi_utm.py
```
5. Follow the prompts to select a domain and enter your request. Hagi-UTM will provide a response based on its knowledge and ethical principles.
Please note that access to Hagi-UTM's full capabilities is restricted and subject to user testing. The `intelligence_test` and `intention_test` functions in the code serve as placeholders for implementing rigorous assessments of a user's cognitive abilities and intentions. Additionally, the `check_user_authorization` function should be implemented to verify a user's credentials for unfiltered access.
